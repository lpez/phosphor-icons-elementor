<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Here are some zip files of the web version of [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com/) icons. I already went thru getting them ready using [Fontello](https://fontello.com/). This is based on version 2.0.2 of Phosphor Icons, and tested on Elementor 3.14.1. You will note that it does not include the duotone icons, fontello made a mess of those so I will see if I can get them working some other way.
